Bespoke Client __*(Pre-Alpha)*__ v0.1

## NOTE
This project is **UNDER-DEVELOPMENT** and is not even close to finished. The current state of it is a framework to integrate and build further scripts for GeoFS with a unified UI system. 

## Current Support
- Helmet Mounted Display
- Lookout - Webcam based head tracking
- Chat Fix - Adds the "t" keybind for talking in chat, which was recently removed.

## Contact
Talk to me via discord, @zetainbeta_43414. I am open to suggestions. Please ensure bugs get to me as soon as noticed. 

## Plan
The vision is an integrated, seamless experience for GeoFS with a modular and scalable design. I have a lot planned. Currently there's no UI, no customisation, no actual features, just a stupid script loading system with some things I made and decided to make public.
