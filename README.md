# How to use
**Reccomended to use with tampermonkey!** Unsure what that is or how to use it? Learn about here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4m8PMzWa_8 . 

## NOTE
This project is **UNDER-DEVELOPMENT** and is not even close to finished. The current state of it is a framework to integrate and build further scripts for GeoFS with a unified UI system. 

## Current Support
- Helmet Mounted Display
- Lookout - Webcam based head tracking, learn more about it [here.](https://github.com/ZetaPossibly/Bespoke-Client/blob/main/scripts/lookout/README.md)
- Chat Fix - Adds the "t" keybind for talking in chat, which was recently removed.

## Contact
Talk to me via discord, @zetainbeta_43414. I am open to suggestions. Please ensure bugs get to me as soon as noticed. 

## Plan
The vision is an integrated, seamless experience for GeoFS with a modular and scalable design. I have a lot planned. Currently there's no UI, no customisation, no actual features, just a stupid script loading system with some things I made and decided to make public.
