# Lookout
A natural user input Interface for GeoFS using webcam-based head tracking. 
Processes webcam data natively on-device. 

# How to use
**Reccomended to use with tampermonkey!** Unsure what that is or how to use it? Learn about here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4m8PMzWa_8

# Requirements
A webcam, nothing fancy. Placed preferably directly in front of you or in more extreme angles, it will glitch out. 

Test if your webcam can reasonably detect your face here: https://jeeliz.com/demos/faceFilter/demos/CSS3D/comedy-glasses/
- If your face is accurately detected, you'll be fine.
