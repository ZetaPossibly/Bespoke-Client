An Eschaton Project.

# Lookout
No extra equipment or setup apart from a webcam. Tracks head rotation and translates into ingame camera manipulation, **locally computed** in real time.  You can rotate your head in all axes with it being translated ingame.

# Requirements
A webcam, nothing fancy. Placed preferably directly in front of you or in more extreme angles, it will glitch out. 

Test if your webcam can reasonably detect your face here: https://jeeliz.com/demos/faceFilter/demos/CSS3D/comedy-glasses/
- If your face is accurately detected, you'll be fine.
